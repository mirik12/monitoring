Rating:

(junior): The stack is forked and stacked at the local dev-environment for the demo project for the help of docker-compose

https://github.com/den-vasyliev/kbot/blob/opentelemetry/otel/docker-compose.yaml

 (middle): The stack is broken and stacked at the dev-middle in Kubernetes for a personal project. Fluentbit collects and exports project logs and all nodes to the cluster.

(senior): The stack is broken and stacked at the dev-middle in Kubernetes for the power project behind the Flux help. Otel fired by the operator. Fluentbit collects and exports logs from a project and a successful node to a cluster. The project is instrumented for exporting metrics.
(principal): The project was instrumented with a cross-cut TraceID

Suggestion: sent to the repository with instructions and the code for distributing the monitoring stack, the Readme file includes a demo of the Grafana dashboard.

# Monitoring Stack for Your Project

This repository contains the code and configuration for deploying a monitoring stack in your local dev environment using Docker Compose. The stack includes the following components:

- OpenTelemetry
- Prometheus
- Fluent Bit
- Grafana Loki
- Grafana

## Deployment Instructions

Start the monitoring stack using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up -d
Once the stack is successfully launched, you can access various components:

OpenTelemetry: http://localhost:4317
Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
Grafana: http://localhost:3000 (login: admin, password: admin)
Grafana Demo Dashboard
The repository also includes a demo dashboard for Grafana, which displays data from the collected metrics. To view the dashboard, follow these steps:

Open a web browser and go to http://localhost:3000.

Log in to Grafana using the following credentials:
